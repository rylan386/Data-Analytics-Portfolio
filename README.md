## About

Hello, I'm Rylan Ornelas, a data analyst coming from a non traditional background, I am passionate about the power that data holds. Data is more than just numbers - it represents people, behaviors, and patterns. With data analysis, we can understand trends, gain insights and make informed decisions. I believe that data is the key to unlocking solutions to some of the most pressing problems we face today. I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.
